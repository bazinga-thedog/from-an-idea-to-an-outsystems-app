From an idea to an OutSystems App is a series of live streams on Twitch [@bazinga_thedog](https://www.twitch.tv/bazinga_thedog), showing how to implement an application based on an idea, live coding and discussing out loud some of the design decisions that are being made along the way. 
This will lead to future changes, but that is also part of the process, changes will happen and developers need to be able to deal with it.

The end goal is an OutSystems application called Padel Personal Coach, a companion app to support on the journey to become a better padel player.

All the episodes will be available in YT and check all the code generated until the end of each episode in the repo's folders:
* [Part I - Data Model, Roles, Recover admin password, List and Create Match Screens](https://youtu.be/X8aQ6hHV7F0?feature=shared&t=10)
* [Part II - RESTful API, API test in Python with pytest and Natural Language Querying](https://youtu.be/ohxSvITJsZk?feature=shared&t=20)

Bazinga the dog could be an alter-ego, but it's actually my dog. Using his identity allows me not to be liable of anything I do or make (unless it is something worth of an award).I really like software development, maybe the digital version of pottery!
