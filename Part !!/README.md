In the end of Part II, we'll have created the GET, POST and DELETE of a RESTful API for the entity Match. Also, we created unit tests to test these exposed API, using pyhton and pytest. An importer was created to import data from a CSV into the application. Last but not least, a tip on how to use the natural language query mechanism in service studio to help.

The episode has already been uploaded in YT:
